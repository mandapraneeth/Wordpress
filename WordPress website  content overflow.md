In the Ireca Rent Anything theme for WordPress, you can change the logo using the following methods:

**1\. Using the WordPress Customizer:**

*   Navigate to your WordPress dashboard.
*   Go to **Appearance** > **Customize**.
*   In the Customizer, look for the **Header** section or a similar option where you can upload or change your site's logo.

This method allows you to set a global logo that will appear across your entire site.

**2\. Setting a Logo for Individual Pages, Posts, or Products:**

*   Edit the specific page, post, or product where you want a different logo.
*   In the editor, locate the **General Settings** area.
*   Within this section, you can choose a header version and customize settings such as the logo and colors for that particular page.

This approach enables you to have different logos on different sections of your site, providing flexibility in branding.

If the scrollbar in your **WordPress website** is moving due to **content overflow**, here‚Äôs how you can **fix it**:

### **1\. Check CSS for Overflow Issues**

Add this CSS to your theme‚Äôs **Additional CSS** section (under Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS):

```css
html, body {
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

This prevents horizontal scrolling.

### **2\. Set Max Width for Containers**

If content is overflowing, set a **max-width** for containers:

```css
.container {
    max-width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

### **3\. Inspect Elements in Developer Tools**

*   Right-click on the page and select **Inspect** (or press `F12`).
*   Look for any sections that exceed the screen width.
*   Adjust width or remove extra margins.

### **4\. Disable Unnecessary Plugins**

Some plugins (like sliders, page builders) may cause overflow issues. Try disabling them one by one and check.

### **5\. Check Theme Settings**

*   If using **Elementor or WPBakery**, adjust section width in settings.
*   Set **"Stretch Section"** to **off** in Elementor.

### **6\. Check Custom JavaScript**

If you added custom JavaScript, ensure it‚Äôs not modifying the body width.

Apply these fixes and check if your scrolling issue is resolved! üöÄ Let me know if you need further help. üòä
